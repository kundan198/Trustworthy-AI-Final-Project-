# Trustworthy Sign Language Translator

A machine learning project focused on building a **Sign Language Translator** that is **accurate**, **fair across demographics**, and **robust** to real-world conditions like lighting changes and occlusion.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Goal:** Recognize hand gestures reliably across different skin tones, hand shapes, and environmental conditions.
- **Approach:**
  - Use hand landmark data.
  - Train a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras.
  - Explicitly evaluate **fairness** across demographic groups.
  - Assess **robustness** to noise and real-world distortions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib (optional for visualization)

## 📊 Evaluation

- **Fairness Metrics:**  
  We evaluated model performance (accuracy, precision, recall) **separately** for different demographic groups based on skin tone.

- **Robustness Observation:**  
  Due to normalization and preprocessing, the model showed **consistent accuracy** even under blurred, occluded, or low-light conditions. Formal robustness evaluation is planned for future updates.

📈 Future Work
Extend recognition from single gestures to full sentences.

Add explainability features to show how predictions are made.

Deploy the model on edge devices (e.g., mobile phones, Raspberry Pi).
