ðŸ§  Trustworthy Sign Language Translator
This project builds a Sign Language Translator model that not only achieves high accuracy, but also explicitly evaluates fairness and robustness â€” two critical factors for real-world, trustworthy AI applications.

ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
Goal: Recognize hand gestures (sign language) accurately and ensure the model treats all demographic groups (e.g., different skin tones) fairly.

Innovation:

Evaluates fairness using demographic-based metrics (accuracy, precision, recall across different groups).

Handles robustness via normalization, ensuring the model stays accurate even under noise like blurring, occlusion, or lighting variations.

ðŸš€ Key Features
Deep Learning model using TensorFlow/Keras.

Dataset:

landmarks_data.csv: Hand landmark coordinates.

demographic_data.csv: Demographic info like skin tone.

Fairness Evaluation:
Calculates group-wise accuracy, precision, and recall to check if the model performs equally across diverse users.

Robustness Handling:
Input normalization techniques help the model generalize even when image conditions are imperfect (e.g., blur, occlusion).

ðŸ›  How To Run
Install the requirements:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Train the model:

bash
Copy
Edit
python train_data.py
Outputs:

sign_language_model.keras â€” saved model.

label_classes.npy â€” label encoder classes.

Prints Fairness Metrics after evaluation.

ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy

Recall

Fairness Metrics: Group-wise comparison (skin tone based)

Robustness: Verified indirectly through normalized inputs.

ðŸ§© Future Work
Extend to complete sentence recognition (not just gestures).

Add Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to make model decisions understandable.

Deploy on edge devices like mobile phones for real-time, offline translation.

ðŸ§  Lessons Learned
Just achieving high accuracy is not enough.

True AI trustworthiness needs fairness and robustness evaluations.

Demographic bias and real-world variability must be tackled seriously.
